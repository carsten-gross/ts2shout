# ts2shout
ts2shout is a small software that acts as a filter or cgi programm to convert a single
program mpeg transport stream directly to a webradio compatible shoutcast stream. 
I actually use it for playing DVB-C on Squeezebox players. Please see my page 
http://www.siski.de/~carsten/radio-streaming-squeezebox.html for more information.

It is heavily based on the dvbshout application by Nicholas J. Humfrey
(https://github.com/njh/dvbshout) - but the use case here is completly
different. ts2shout uses autoconfiguration by reading PAT and PMT tables from a
single program mpeg transport stream and outputs a native mpeg (or shoutcast) stream 
directly.

There are two modes, one is very like a traditional unix filter: a mpeg transport stream
is read from stdin and it is filtered to stdout. Error and info messages are directed to 
sterr. 

The other mode is CGI (common gateway interface) mode. This avoids hasseling
around with shoutcast like parameters (liky icy-sr, icy-br etc.) which are read
directly from the mpeg transport stream and output in the corrosponding and
required header lines. To support this mode libcurl is used for accessing
tvheadend. This means libcurl (and the corrosponding libcurl-dev package for
compiling) is required for ts2shout to work. 

The ts2shout reads a mpeg transport stream directly from stdin or from a given
http URL containing a single programm transport stream generated by
applications like tvheadend. ts2shout outputs a shoutcast stream with the first
found mpeg audio stream in PAT/PMT and the "current programm" from the mpeg EIT
("EPG") translated to "StreamTitle" all 8192 bytes inside the mpeg stream. This
is a standard for most shoutcast radio-stations and described in
http://www.smackfu.com/stuff/programming/shoutcast.html. ts2shout should work
with most DVB-C/DVB-S radio stations and was tested by myself with Unitymedia
DVB-C network.

Just compile the application with make on your linux box and install it
manually e.g. to /usr/local/bin/ts2shout . It does not need any libraries for
shoutcast or mpeg as it just parses and uses a sub-extreme-minimum set of mpeg
specification just to work for me in my special setup to get stream information
on the Squeezebox.

It can be used in conjunction with tvheadend and apache as follows: 

Activate module mod_action (a2enmod action)

On a Debian system change /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf as follows. Use a virtual server
from your apache2 installation as you wish. 

It assumes that your tvheadend is reachable via localhost. Change/Adjust
ProxyPass for the radio-URL, and the allow/deny lists. 

If shoutcast Streamtitles should be used inside the stream is autodetected by
the Icy-MetaData header given in the http request.
